We made our SecurePaste project using the Django framework. To start, we followed a Youtube tutorial on Django web applications and modified the application created after this tutorial into what we have uploaded here.

Our project uses an SQLite database to store user data.

All HTML files are contained inside either paste/templates/paste/ or users/templates/users/

To run the webapp, navigate to the directory which contains the manage.py file and run the command "python manage.py runsslserver" If it does not seem to run you may missing one or more extra frameworks used in this project like Pillow, Crispy Forms, etc.

SecurePaste has many functionalities, for example: Users navigate to the web app and are displayed the most recent 10 posts made. If they wish to make a new post, they can do so by clicking the New Post button in the navigation bar. If the user does not have an account, they will be redirected to create one at this time. Once a post is created, users can make their posts private and specify a list of other users they wish to be able to see this posts contents.
